# Instructions

## 1. How to run the code:
In order to run the code, simply execute the main.py file. The price information file (prices.txt) needs to be in the
same directory as the main.py file, otherwise the code will not find the price data and thus will fail.

## 2. Runtime of the code:
Two methos have been implemented in the **PairFinder** class: **find_in_O_n** and **find_in_O_n2**
As the names suggest, the two methods find the solution in O(n) or O(n^2) runtime. 


## 3. Consider 3 gifts (bonus question):
The inital problem is a simplified version of the Knapsack problem. If 3 gifts were considered, a solution could be found in O(n) time using dynamic programming. (Solution has not been implemented)
