# Interview coding challenge for Paxos

The repository contains the source code to the two coding challenges. A more detailed instruction on how to run the code is given in a seperate README.md file within folders. These instructions also contain the answer to the additional questions, which had been asked. 

Thank you very much for have given me the chance to solve those challenges. I truly enjoyed working on it.
